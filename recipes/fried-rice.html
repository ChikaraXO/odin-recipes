        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An ideal choice for using up leftover rice in the fridge, along with some eggs, peas, 
            carrots, and garlic, fried rice is a quick, inexpensive, and very delicious meal for 
            the weeknights. You can also add in some leftover proteins to make the meal more filling,
            and spare your wallet from more takeout this week.</p>
        
        <p>This recipe will teach you how to make fried rice at home, no wok required(though using 
            a wok is a great way to cook this dish!), and I will even include instructions should you
            not have any leftover rice on hand.</p>
